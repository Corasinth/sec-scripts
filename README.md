### sql-command-generator

To install `sql-command-generator`, you need to first install [AutoHotKeyScript v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/). 

Then click the green `Code` button on this repository and download it as a zip file. Unpack it, run `sql-command-generator.ahk`, follow the dialogue prompts, and the SQL command will be copied to your clipboard. 

You can change the default value for the name of the main database table by opening the `sql-command-generator.ahk` file with a text editor like Notepad and changing the `databaseFileName` variable. Simply change the text in the quotes next to the variable, save, and the next time you run the `sql-command-generator.ahk` script the default text should have changed.
